// To summarize a good explanation of the differences between Next.js SSR and Server Components from Dan Abramov:

// Code for Server Components is never delivered to the client
// Server components enable access to the back-end from anywhere in the tree
// Server Components may be refetched while maintaining Client-side state inside of the tree
